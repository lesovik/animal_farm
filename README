Challenge:

Your goal is to generate a PHP script that utilizes an object oriented approach to do the

following:

­ Create a base animal class that contains a serial number property

­ Create the following child classes "goat" and "sheep"

­ Generate 100 unique and random prime numbers from 0 to 10,000. Attribute each

"serial" prime number to a baby goat, and store in file goat.txt.

­ Generate serial numbers using the same method for sheep, and save in sheep.txt.

­ Find all instances where the serial numbers assigned to goat and sheep are equal and

save these serials to a new file called soulmates.txt.

­ Output to screen: interesting facts about each set of serial numbers generated (ie.

average sum, mean, . get creative)
